# ChowTape for Multiverse

This repository contains ports of the [Chow Tape Model](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel)
audio effect for the [Multiverse guitar pedal platform](https://aviateaudio.com/products/multiverse-pedal).

Since Chow Tape Model is an effect with a lot of parameters, this port splits up the effect
into multiple effect "pedals". The first is [Chow Tape Saturation](https://aviateaudio.com/collections/effects/products/chow-tape-saturation),
which contains the tape saturation and tape loss emulations from the original plugin, as
well as the "emphasis" filters present in the original plugin. The second effect is
[Chow Tape Modulation](https://aviateaudio.com/collections/effects/products/chow-tape-modulation),
which contains the "Wow" and "Flutter" processing from the original plugin. It is possible
that additional effects will be added in the future!
