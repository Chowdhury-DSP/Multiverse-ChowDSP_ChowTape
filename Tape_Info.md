# ChowTape

## One-Sentence Description

Chow Tape is a series of audio effects based on a physical model of a reel-to-reel tape recorder.

## Description of Effect (Saturation)

Tape Saturation is a saturation effect achieved through a
physics-based model of a reel-to-reel tape machine. The
effect uses a discretization of the Jiles-Atherton equation
to emulate the magnetic hysteresis process which is results
in the magnetization of the domains in the tape itself. The
end result is a smooth and dynamic saturation effect, which
can be under-biased or over-biased just like a real tape
machine.

The effect also includes pre- and post-emphasis filters similar
to those often used by reel-to-reel tape machines, which can
be controlled by the "Tone" knob, as well as filters that emulate
the loss of certain frequency content in the signal, depending
on the "Speed" of the tape used for recording.

# Description of Effect (Modulation)

Tape Modulation is a modulation effect that emulates
the "Wow" and "Flutter" effects often present in analog
tape recordings due to inconsistencies in the tape
speed during recording or playback. While tape machines
were built with the intention of reducing wow and flutter
artifacts, this effect accentuates them for musical effect.

The Flutter effect is modelled directly after the timing
inconsistencies in my own tape recorder, and has controls
for the "Rate" and "Depth" of the effect.

The Wow effect contains similar "Rate" and "Depth" controls,
as well as controls for "Variance" and "Drift", which can
be used to achieve a more random and dynamic effect.
